It is crucial to be patient. The onions will slowly turn from white, to golden, to a deep, rich brown. Scrape the bottom of the pot as you stir to prevent sticking. This long, slow caramelization is what builds the foundational flavor of the soup.",

      "Generously pile the grated Gruyère and Parmesan cheese over the bread and the edge of the bowl.",
      "Carefully place the baking sheet under the broiler. Broil for 3-5 minutes, watching closely, until the cheese is completely melted, bubbly, and spotted with golden brown patches.",

            "Prepare the meat: Clean the lamb or chicken thoroughly. Pat it completely dry with paper towels. Using a sharp knife, make deep slits all over the meat, especially on the thicker parts. This allows the heat and salt to penetrate.",

            "Prepare the fire: The traditional method uses a special Sajji pit or a vertical skewer over a wood or charcoal fire. Let the flames die down to glowing embers and coal for consistent, radiant heat.",
            "Skewer the meat: Impale the whole leg of lamb or chicken onto a large, sturdy metal skewer (seekh). Secure it well so it doesn't rotate loosely.",
            "Roast: Position the skewered meat about 2-3 feet away from the heat source. Rotate the skewer slowly and continuously for 2-4 hours (depending on size). The goal is slow, even cooking until the skin is crispy and dark red, and the internal juices run clear.",
            "Prepare stuffing (if using for chicken): While the meat roasts, prepare the rice. In a pot, heat oil and sauté onions until golden. Add cumin seeds, then drained rice. Add salt and water/stock. Cook until rice is done.",
            "Rest and serve: Once cooked, remove the meat from the skewer and let it rest for 15 minutes. For chicken, you can stuff it with the prepared rice. Carve the lamb into large pieces. Serve on a large platter, traditionally with a side of 'Kaak' (hard, tandoor-baked bread) and a simple tomato-based dipping sauce or raita."
